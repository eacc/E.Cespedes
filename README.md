# Hi, I'm Eddy Cespedes

Hello, Iâ€™m eacc, a Dominican Web Developer, recently moved to Peru learning everything I can about this beautiful country.

I started Web development by pure coincidence and since it became one of my true hobbies, currently working on personal projects and improving my skills in this wonderful world of programming.
